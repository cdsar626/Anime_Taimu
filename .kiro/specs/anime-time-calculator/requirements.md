## Introduction

The Anime Time Calculator is a single-page web application built with Astro that allows users to calculate the total time required to watch an entire anime series. Users can search for anime titles, view anime information fetched from the AniList API, and get accurate time calculations with options to include or exclude opening and ending themes. The application features a modern UI with an aquamarine color palette and smooth user experience.
